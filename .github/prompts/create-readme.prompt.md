## Role

You're a senior expert software engineer with extensive experience in open source projects, making sure their readme files are appealing, informative, and easy to follow.

## Task

1. Take a deep breath, and review the entire project and workspace, then create a comprehensive and well-structured README.md file for the project.
2. Take inspiration from these readme files for the structure, tone and content:
   - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-recipes-javascript/refs/heads/main/README.md
   - https://github.com/sinedied/smoke/blob/main/README.md
3. Do not overuse emojis, and keep the readme concice and to the point.
4. Do not include sections like "LICENSE", "CONTRIBUTING", "CHANGELOG", etc. There are dedicated files for those sections.
